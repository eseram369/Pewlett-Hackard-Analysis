# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

### Overview of the analysis
#### The purpose of this analysis was to project the number of employees who might be retiring soon at a large company called Pewlett-Hackard. It will help the company estimate the number of retirement packages they might offer and identify which positions will need to be filled. Due to its size, a sudden surge in retiring employees could leave vast portions of their workforce vacant. Conducting this analysis now helps Pewlett-Hackard plan and protect themselves from sudden shocks to their business.

### Results
#### To determine the requirement criteria, we combined several datasets and filtered them only to show employees born between 1952 and 1955. From there, the combined dataset was organized by job title, and the potential retirees in each title were totaled. A second table was constructed from the original six datasets to identify employees born in 1965 who are still with Pewlett-Hackard. These employees are potential candidates for a mentorship program, where a retiring employee trains them to fill the position they are leaving.

### 1) Retirement by title
    - The most urgent item Pewlett-Hackard needs to address is the possibility of almost 45,000 engineers retiring. Right now, they have 29,414 employees with the title of Senior Engineer who meet the criteria for a near-future retirement. There are also 14,222 employees with the title of Engineer who also meet the requirements. A plan needs to be implemented to attract middle and senior-level engineers to fill these roles. Promoting is an option, but that will be tough given the number of middle-level engineers potentially retiring.
    
    - Middle management will be unaffected by possible retirement. There are only two employees with the title of manager who meet the criteria for potential pension. Pewlett-Hackard can look to existing managers to potentially fill Senior Leadership positions that might open. There are 28,254 employees with the title of Senior Staff who meet the retirement criteria.
    
    
### 2) Mentorship Possibilities

    - The mentorship program would not be able to fill all the positions potentially opening. Under the current criteria, there are only 1,549 employees who could be mentored. With 14,222 mid-level engineering positions opening, this would be insufficient for just that one role, let alone across the whole company.
    
    - It also does not consider whether the employees are ready to be mentored and transition into more senior positions. Some employees do hit the ceiling in terms of career advancement. Others might have recently been promoted to their current situation and might not have enough experience to be promoted again. The query we used does provide a list of employees for mentoring, but these factors limit it.
    
### Summary
    - How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

Pewlett-Hackard will need to fill 90,398 positions over the course of the "Silver Tsunami".

    - Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

There are enough qualified, retirement-ready employees ready to mentor the next generation of Pewlett-Hackard employees. 98% of the employees retiring are senior or mid-level based on their titles. However, the pool of employees eligible for mentorship is far too small to fill all the positions that would be vacated.
